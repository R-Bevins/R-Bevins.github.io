        <p class="about">Hello, my name is Ryan! I’m a recent student of the Computer Animation and Web Design program at the Center for Technology, Essex. I’m passionate about art and animation (starting from a young age where I doodled on almost every homework assignment), and I hope to do it for a living. Some of my awards include 1st place at the state level and 4th place at the national level for the SkillsUSA 3D Animation and Visualization competition in 2022. Other achievements include Associate Web Development certification, and the Messiest Desk Award in Mrs. Schroeder’s 3rd Grade Class (circa 2014).</p>

        <p class="about">I was born and raised in Vermont since 2005 and was diagnosed with Crohn’s Disease in 2014. One of those things has greatly affected my health, my perspective on life, and my diet. The other is Crohn’s Disease. However, both have helped make me who I am today.

        <p class="about">
            In this web portfolio, you'll find examples of the various kinds of work I can do. Such as animation, drawing, 3D modeling, and photography.

        <h2>My Path</h2>
        <p class="about">“Often what may appear as a detour in life is actually the most direct and empowering path to your destination.” - James Arthur Ray. This quote resonates with me because my path in life hit what I thought was a major detour when the Covid pandemic started. It had initially been my plan in life to do four regular years of high school. That changed when I needed to start doing school fully remote due to the pandemic since I have a compromised immune system. I thought it was a detour at the time, and that I would go back to doing regular school the next year. It was a difficult period of time for me, but I got through it by thinking about how things would eventually go back to normal.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="about">However, things didn’t go back to normal for me. Since I had already deviated from the planned path, my parents (who have been very influential in and supportive of my education) thought it would be a good idea to look into the local technical schools as a possibility for my junior year. My mom thought the Computer Animation and Web Design program CTE offered would be a good fit for me because of how artistic and interested in technology I am, so I decided to apply to it. I got into that program, and it’s one of the things I’ve done the most consistently well in.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="about">I am now in my second year of CAWD. It’s been one of the best experiences of my life. I’ve learned so much from it and grown greatly as an artist and student. I’ve learned about how the industry operates and what the potential work loads are like alongside my peers and friends. I’ve become much more dedicated as a worker. Having found work I’m invested in, I’m more inspired to do my best, be a hard worker, and be committed to making high quality projects.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="about">My hope for college is to be able to continue to grow and become a better worker and artist. I believe I’ll be able to accomplish this because I’m going to a highly rated college that has the resources and professors that’ll help me improve if I properly apply myself. I plan to continue to do my best as a student when I get there in order to make sure that goal is met.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="about">My hopes for my career are to be able to work on top tier, high quality animation productions. I want to be able to create great works of animation that others will be able to enjoy and be inspired by as much as previous works have inspired me. I believe that I’ll be able to accomplish this and make work that I’m proud of by making sure I do get the most out of college. At college, I’ll be able to improve my skill set to the point where I’m able to work on such projects, and I’ll be able to make connections in the industry that can potentially help me. With that, I can make my goals reality.</p>
